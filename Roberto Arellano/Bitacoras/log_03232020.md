Session 03/23/2020

Today we spoke about how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our final projects. Since we are currently under self-quarantine we cannot proceed with our idea of collecting data via the observation method as we cannot be in contact with large groups of people. In our case, we believe we can continue with the project with only minimal changes since we can still contact our classmates via online means. 

Changes: 

- Our target user will only be students
- Our data obtention method will be interviews(online based) and survey(also online based)
