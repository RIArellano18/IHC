Session 03/12/2020

Today in class we spoke about how we as engineering students need to learn to administrate our projects more professionally. Essentially, we need to be more specific when talking about the objective of the project, elements in the design process, etc. To get a better understanding of this, we were tasked with researching a case study where User Centered Design was used and detail HOW it was used, taking note of elements such as; design process, life cycle used, metrics considered, etc.

Tasks:
- Locate a case study where User Centered Design was used.
- Clean up project repository to include more specific information; explain in detail why we chose the data obtention technique that we did, what instruments we will be using for collecting data.
