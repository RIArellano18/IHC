Session 03/09/2020

Today we were asked to answer a series of questions regarding our final project. While answering these questions, I've considered proposing using the interview method of data elicitation along with the observation method. The reason is that since we're going to observe users, we're also going to need to ask them questions. So, it's best we have a series of pre-established questions, like in a structured interview, to better discover the requirements for this system.

Another idea that I had is that for matching requirements to design, we'll need to conduct various tests to confirm that the requirements are being met. For this we'll need a type of focus group of the expected users to test the prototypes we'll be creating. So we'll need to create a rubric to measure the perceived correctness of these requirements. 

Both of these ideas will be brought up to my project team and discussed.
